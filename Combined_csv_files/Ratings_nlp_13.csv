review,rating
I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile,2
"Phone is only for Calling, Whats App and Youtube.I gifted this phone to my mother, so as per her usage i felt its okay.Worst part is camera.... I even had Redmi Note 4.... I seriously felt Note 4  camera is much better that redmi 9.I got this phone in 7500/-",2
"Cons :- Orange Back different from that shown in product pictures. Not attractive.- No battery charging indicator light.Once the mobile goes in sleep mode, you cannot figure if it is charging or not.- Defective Sound System : volume is generally low. No Bass At All. Sound Volume goes up and down on its own while playing songs/video.- Extremely Short (half meter) charging cable- Micro-USB B-type port- Outdated handset. Not worth the money.- No RETURN Option despite receiving defective piece- No Option to schedule technician visit before replacement window closes (all slots permanently full)Stuck with a defective handset.No scope of Return & purchasing another model.This feels like fraud.Disappointed with Amazon for the first time.",2
"If you pay peanuts you get monkeys - that's quite true for the Redmi 9. With good specs on paper available at the then low price of Rs 9000 I made a greed-fueled decision to go for this. After 3 months I find the glass has scratched all too easily (as opposed to my Lenovo smartphone), the MIUI OS is buggy as hell and the gyroscope just does not work so moving the phone around does not change the orientation in GPS maps (or games). Overall a pathetic device.",2

  ¬†First worst experience with amazon while purchasing mobile. There is a small creamish spot inside the screen, could be manufacturing defect or could be the result of improper handling. Even after replacement I got a defective piece again with screen tint issue on the left side of the camera. Video posted. Dropped Amazon and went to Flipkart now.",2
"Good look phone with 5000mh battery, but camera quality too disappointing. No IR blaster, No C type port. I had purchased redmi 9 (4/64) by exchanging Redmiy3 (3/32) . But actulalky redmi y3 is far better then redmi9. I desire to return it. If any one want to purchase redmi phone then go for redmi 9 prime and avoid to buy redmi9",2
4GB RAM 64GB StorageColour: blackDONT BUY THIS MOBILE .Don‚Äôt buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON‚ÄôT buy this mobile,2
"Redmi 9... Other than MIUI 12.0.5, 4GBRAM &64GB this phone is very ordinary. The CAMERA is worst compared to older phones frm XIAOMI..NO LED LIGHT FOR NOTIFICATIONS...overall nothing impressive in this phone.. Quite disappointed.ADDING one PROS abt the phone:Sound quality is good.Battery life good.",2
Camera quality not great compared to Oppo.... I don't recommend buying this phone. It gets heated up too soon and sometimes screen gets frozen or keeps flickering...,2
I bought this for my mother in law and she expressed that it is not receiving the signal properly where as my father in law samsung at the same home same location is working all fine with same service provider.,2
Very bad camera quality. Though RAM is 4GB but performance of Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 is too good (3GB ram). Battery backup is not too good. Very bad picture quality during video call. Not satisfied,2
